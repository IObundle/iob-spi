The following are FPGA implementation results for two FPGA device families. 
BRAM usage results depend on the configured size of the RX and TX FIFOs, as well as
the number of TX/RX pins, and the number of bits for the DMA. The below results
use the as configurations 10 address bits for both FIFOs, 10 pins for TX and RX,
and 32 bits for the DMA.
