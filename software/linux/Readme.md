# IOb SPI Linux Kernel Drivers
- Structure:
    - `drivers/`: directory with linux kernel module drivers for iob_spi
        - `iob_spi_main.c`: driver source
        - `[iob_spi.h]` and `[iob_spi_sysfs.h]`: header files generated by:
        ```bash
        python3 .path/to/iob-linux/scripts/drivers.py iob_spi -o [output_dir]
        ```
        - `driver.mk`: makefile segment with `iob_spi-obj:` target for driver
          compilation
    - `iob_spi.dts`: device tree template with iob_spi node
        - manually add the `spi` node to the system device tree so the
          iob_spi is recognized by the linux kernel
